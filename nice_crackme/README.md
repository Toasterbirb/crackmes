The password is correct if its length is divisible by 4 and every sequent 4 characters in the password is a palindrome. Thus passwords like "abba" and "abbaabba" would be correct but "abbaa" and "abbaabab" would not be. The solution can be deduced quite easily from the names of the functions in the binary, since the binary has not been stripped.
